# This file is what initialises your code as a python package
# this file is generally left empty but you can use this to shorten your import paths

## For example
## lets say you have a class in presentation.py which you will import it like
##          import AutoPPT.presentation.<class name>

from AutoPPT.presentation import *
## but if you add a that import here in this file then you can import that class using
##          import AutoPPT.<class name>
