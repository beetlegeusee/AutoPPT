![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work_in_progress-<COLOR>.svg)

using web scraping to make a ppt on any topic.
the code generates a basic ppt using beautiful soup, requests and python pptx packages. 

I have also attatched a ppt so you can se what it makes, on putting the input as per the jupyter notebook.

### Future updates would involve features like

1. Implement python package and command line interface 
2. add paragraphs of content from wiki
3. add images                                                                       
4. add tkinter interface   
5. remove numbers from the articles. 
6. be able to put selective information in the slide. not just the first sentence.
